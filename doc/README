This directory contains documentation for the system:
o guide.sgml is the SGML source for the LinuxDoc-Tools User's Guide

These can be built during ``make build'':

o guide.txt is plain text
o guide.pdf is PDF
o guide.dvi is DVI
o guide.ps.gz is gzipped PostScript
o guide.info is in GNU info format
o guide.lyx is LyX format
o html/ contains the HTML version
o rtf/ contains the RTF version

You can fine tune the doc formats to be built by means of the
--enable-docs[=types] configuration option or completely disable doc
building by means of the --disable-docs configuration option.
Possible values are txt pdf info lyx html rtf dvi+ps. This is enabled
by default with value "txt pdf info lyx html rtf".

You should read guide.txt first - it explains how to install the software
and how to write and format documents using the system.

Also, there's example.sgml, which is a simple SGML example. You should
format this example (instructions for doing so in the User's Guide) and
print it out, along with the source, and use it as a model for writing
your own SGML docs. You can also grab the SGML sources for the Linux HOWTOs
from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/sgml. These
documents together will give you a good start on using the system.
